# üõ°Ô∏è Anomaly Detection on cybersecurity logs

**Date:** Jan 12, 2025

Welcome to the **Anomaly Detection on cybersecurity logs** repository! This project offers a creative and structured approach to detecting anomalies in endpoint security and network traffic logs using machine learning techniques.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
1. Initial Data Exploration
Open notebooks/Initial_Anomaly_detection.ipynb.
Run the cells to load and explore the endpoint_security_logs.csv dataset. This notebook helps you understand the structure and content of the security logs.
2. Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoder
Open notebooks/Cybersecurity_logs.ipynb.
Execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the LSTM autoencoder, detect anomalies in the network traffic logs, and export the results to exported_anomalies.csv.
